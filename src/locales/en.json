      "description": "<strong>SIGHT Senses – Wearable Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired</strong>\n\nSIGHT Senses is an academic engineering project focused on developing a <strong>wearable guidance system</strong> for visually impaired users. The device integrates <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>spatial audio</strong>, and <strong>haptic feedback</strong> into a unified architecture powered by a <em>Raspberry Pi</em>. It processes environmental information in real time to provide intuitive, multisensory navigation assistance.\n\n<strong>System Overview</strong>\n\nThe core system is structured around the Raspberry Pi, which synchronizes three technical modules: <em>image processing</em>, <em>sound spatialization</em>, and <em>haptic feedback</em>. Each module operates independently but exchanges data continuously to ensure real-time reactivity. A startup script (<code>crontab</code>) allows the device to launch automatically and operate autonomously once powered on.\n\n<strong>Image Processing (Python + OpenCV)</strong>\n\nThe vision module captures frames from the onboard camera and performs real-time <strong>shape and obstacle detection</strong>. Using OpenCV, it applies color-based segmentation (<code>cv2.inRange()</code>), Gaussian blur for noise reduction, and contour extraction (<code>cv2.findContours()</code>). It identifies <em>squares</em> and <em>crosses</em> via polygon approximation (<code>cv2.approxPolyDP()</code>) and geometric filtering (convexity, aspect ratio). Blue lines are also detected for path alignment. Once detected, the position and type of each element are transmitted to the feedback modules. For efficiency, only the most relevant shapes (largest or most centered) are kept, and vectorized OpenCV operations ensure fast computation.\n\n<strong>Distance and Obstacle Detection (Lidar)</strong>\n\nA <strong>TFLuna Lidar</strong> sensor continuously measures distances via serial communication (<code>/dev/serial0</code>). The readings are analyzed to detect obstacles and quantify proximity. Dynamic thresholds translate distance into feedback intensity, synchronizing the haptic and audio responses. This enables continuous awareness of surrounding obstacles, even in low-light or visually complex environments.\n\n<strong>Audio Processing (Python + PyDub)</strong>\n\nThe <strong>audio feedback system</strong> translates spatial data into directional cues. Built with PyDub, it adjusts stereo balance and timing to simulate a realistic 3D perception of the environment. The <code>balance_sound()</code> function modulates gain and delay between left and right channels depending on the obstacle’s position. Each type of detected object triggers a distinct preloaded sound (square, cross, line, fence), and the volume varies according to distance, offering clear and natural guidance through spatial hearing.\n\n<strong>Haptic Feedback (Python + RPi.GPIO)</strong>\n\nThe <strong>haptic subsystem</strong> complements the audio cues by converting distance data into tactile signals. Controlled via PWM on the Raspberry Pi GPIO, the <code>vibrate()</code> and <code>haptic_()</code> functions generate vibrations of variable frequency and intensity. The closer the obstacle, the stronger and more intermittent the vibration, providing an intuitive sense of spatial proximity. This dual-sensory redundancy (audio + touch) ensures reliable feedback in noisy or distracting environments.\n\n<strong>Hardware Integration and 3D Design</strong>\n\nThe device’s housing was modeled in SolidWorks for ergonomic and modular assembly. It contains the Raspberry Pi, Lidar, camera, battery, and vibration motors in a compact chest-mounted unit. Ventilation channels prevent overheating, while adjustable straps ensure user comfort and correct sensor alignment. The modular structure allows easy replacement and maintenance of components.\n\nThis project demonstrates the seamless integration of <strong>AI-driven perception</strong>, <strong>signal processing</strong>, and <strong>embedded systems</strong> within a wearable navigation device. The system operates autonomously, synchronizing image, sound, and haptic feedback in real time to deliver intuitive and reliable guidance for visually impaired individuals.\n\n"

      "description": "<strong>Real Estate Estimation – Machine Learning Price Prediction for Paris</strong>\n\n<strong>Context and Objectives</strong>\n\nThis project develops a web-based tool for estimating the value of Parisian real estate, combining a machine learning model with a user interface. The system relies on historical real estate transaction data to predict the price of a property based on its main characteristics.\n\n<strong>Data Processing</strong>\n\nThe project uses the public DVF 2024 data (Demandes de Valeurs Foncières) from the French government, which lists all real estate transactions in the country. These raw data are preprocessed with the objective of providing clean and consistent values for the learning model. The preprocessing cleans the raw data by removing duplicates and missing values, converts numerical types, and enriches the dataset with a public transportation proximity score calculated using BallTree. In addition, aberrant prices (>150% of the district average) are filtered out to obtain a coherent dataset for the model.\n\n<strong>Machine Learning and Modeling</strong>\n\nThe predictive model uses the Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm from scikit-learn, an ensemble method particularly effective for regression problems. The architecture includes 200 decision trees (n_estimators=200) with a moderate learning rate (learning_rate=0.1) and a maximum depth of 5 levels to avoid overfitting. The input features include GPS coordinates (longitude, latitude) for geographic localization, postal code, type of property (house, apartment, dependency, commercial unit), surface area in m², and the number of main rooms. Training uses an 80/20 split, and performance is evaluated using the R² coefficient of determination, the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The model is serialized with joblib for efficient deployment.\n\n<strong>Architecture</strong>\n\nThe application combines a FastAPI backend exposing a REST API and a modern React frontend with automatic address geolocation via the Nominatim API."
