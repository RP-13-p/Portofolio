My role combines frontend engineering in React with backend design in FastAPI, emphasizing clean architecture, scalability, and product reliability.\n\n On the frontend, I built and unified key user flows (authentication, subscription, account management) and implemented a full internationalization system using react-i18next. I also redesigned the navigation and form components to enhance UX consistency and code maintainability.\n\n On the backend, I developed and documented major REST endpoints (account management, contact, password reset/change) and contributed to the ChatPDF feature, integrating a document ingestion and vectorization pipeline to support contextualized Q&A.\n\n Since the end of the internship, I have continued working remotely with the CiviBot team, supporting the product’s technical growth and continuous integration."
